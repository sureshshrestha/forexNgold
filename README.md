==========
ForexNgold is a common platform for those enthusiasts who have a keen interest in present status of market value of gold and present foreign exchange rates. We have used visualization tools like Highstock and Mapbox to give life to the collected data.

The main motivation for this project is to develop an open data based web application with the datasets of foreign currency exchange rates and the price of gold in the Nepali market. First we can observe the instability of Nepali Rupee in comparison to major foreign currencies i.e. US dollar, Euro, St. Pound, etc. By comparing the value of dollar and price of gold we have visually shown the indirect correlation relationship between gold and US dollar.
